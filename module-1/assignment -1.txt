/*** What is the Feasibility Study of the SDLC model & why is this important? */
The feasibility study is the first step in the software development life cycle model.

Include three steps in feasibility study. And it's:
1. Technical feasibility: Technical feasibility mean whether it is possible to create the software technically
2. Operational feasibility: Operational feasibility mean whether all need fill of the client
3. Economic feasibility: Economic feasibility mean whether financial got gain

The step get decides that the software is go next step or stop now. The feasibility step is important step becase it's help determind if a proposed software project is value, pracical and cost-effective.

/*** Write 5 advantages of Agile methodology. */
1. requirement changing opurcunemit
2. software quality increase
3. calculation of how much has been completed
4. 1 part complete then it's part delivery client ((CI/CD)
5. multiple team working

/*** Write short notes on SDLC model phase. */
SDLC means Software Devlopment Life Cycle. The Software Devlopment Life Cycle is a process of software development, where we develop software in a systematic way.

SDLC have 7 step And it's:
1.Planning and requirement analysis
2.Defining Requirements
3.Designing the Software
4.Developing the project
5.Testing
6.Deployment
7.Maintenance

The SDLC is a systematic approach to software development. It consists of various phases, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Each phase has specific objectives and deliverables, which must be completed before proceeding to the next phase. The SDLC ensures that the software development process is efficient, and the end product meets the stakeholders' requirements. The SDLC model can be adapted to fit different methodologies, such as Agile, Waterfall, or Hybrid.
